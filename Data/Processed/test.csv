Facts are stubborn things,

Another stubborn fact is that you can be desensitized to peanut allergies,

Regardless of how many caveats an airline might state in its contract terms, passengers neither want nor deserve a ticket for an oversold seat.
Bumping is a purely economic device that treats passengers as economic units devoid of humanity, like so many other aspects of airline behavior.

I frequently reserve flights up to one year in advance, in order to secure the lowest price and best seat.
I do this even though the airline will charge me $150 (plus fare difference) to change my itinerary for personal reasons once booked.
However, the airline frequently change flight schedules for confirmed passengers without compensation, nor consideration of passengers' plans.
For example, a trip to Europe on United Airlines has now been changed 7 times by the airline since I confirmed my reservation in December 2009.
The resulting changes have added nearly 5 hours to the total trip, plus I'm now required to leave at 3AM for the airport (instead of my original departure of 8AM), and I return after midnight, rather than a more reasonable 10:30PM.
In addition, United Airlines has not offered to waive the change fee, nor provide seats on alternate dates or airline partners.
If I'm required to pay exorbitant fees to the airlines to change my original itinerary, due to personal circumstances, then the airlines should also be required to compensate inconvenienced passengers in full AND provide satisfactory alternate travel arrangements comparable to the original flight schedule.
Perhaps this would force the airlines to recognize the hardships they create for passengers when schedules are revised after passengers have already received confirmed flights and make related travel arrangements."""

However, the airline frequently change flight schedules for confirmed passengers without compensation, nor consideration of passengers' plans.

In addition, United Airlines has not offered to waive the change fee, nor provide seats on alternate dates or airline partners.
If I'm required to pay exorbitant fees to the airlines to change my original itinerary, due to personal circumstances, then the airlines should also be required to compensate inconvenienced passengers in full AND provide satisfactory alternate travel arrangements comparable to the original flight schedule.

jsooudi: ""I'm a physician, epidemiologist, and mother to a four year old boy with allergies to milk, peanuts and egg.
My son's dairy allergy is severe,
and he has had numerous lifethreatening anaphylactic reactions to trace amounts of milk,
which required multiple doses of epinephrine and trips to the Emergency Department.
Tests indicate that his peanut allergy is worse,
but fortunately he has only been exposed once to a peanut;
he put one in his mouth and had a relatively mild  reaction.
I've traveled with my children
and despite calling ahead, making requests, and reminding employees at the door, I've rarely had respect, let alone consistency, in any kind of peanutfree buffer zone or flight.
Several years ago Continental Airlines customer service headquarters informed me that they would serve peanuts on all flights as they were unable to guarantee a peanut free flight.
(So why not hand out weapons since they can't guarantee a weapon free flight either?)
I've sat with my epi pen in hand on a filthy flight with visible peanut crumbs on the floor while a flight attendant insisted on offering peanuts to the passengers around me because ""it was their right.""
Fortunately for me, my son's peanut allergy is not severe enough that it prohibits us from air travel.
Now that he is old enough to not put things in his mouth, and to protect himself, we are safer.
However, I know of many, many others in the allergy community, children and adults who simply can NOT fly.
My son's dairy allergy is quite severe.
The world would be a much safer place for us if no one consumed milk near him.
If his skin touches anything that once touched milk, even if it was partially cleaned, he will get severe hives.
If he consumes even less than a drop, within seconds his lips, eyes and face will swell, he will be covered in hives, vomit, and be gasping for breath.
Without epinephrine he would probably die within minutes.
But milk is ubiquitous,
and milk allergy relatively uncommon,
so we must protect ourselves.
Peanut allergy is common,
and it is a simple step to serve an alternative peanut based snacks for a short period of time.
So why is this a big problem?
The vast majority of potential reactions would be eliminated by simply avoiding snacks that have peanuts or peanut butter as an ingredient.
Peanut oil is known to contain very little of the actual peanut protein,
and would be of little risk in an airborne environment.
As a physician, I have responded to the call from airline staff asking for emergency medical assistance.
I am well aware of how expensive and inconvenient it is to ground a plane.
In addition, most epipens come in two pack doses,
each of which are good for maybe 10 to 15 minutes.
Which in a severe anaphylactic reaction is simply not enough time between the beginning of a reaction and the patient reaching EMS.
I've found that other passengers, as a rule, are extremely supportive,
and are more than happy to help with a fellow passengers safety.
I think the people commenting on this site would react entirely differently were they seated next to an allergic child on a plane.
Of course they would refrain from eating peanuts for a few hours if they knew it would hurt someone they were looking in the face.
But I am sympathetic to individuals who are unhappy with yet another discomfort inflicted on air travelers.
This restriction is designed to protect people with allergies from the airlines callous disregard for cleanliness and for our safety, not from our fellow passengers.
""Hi.  My name is Steven.  I am 4 years old.
I am allergic to peanuts, eggs and cow milk.
If I eat a peanut I'll get sick.
I ate a nut one time and got a big bump on my lip and it swelled up and it was hard to breathe.
It was scary and my dad gave me some medicine that made it better.
I would like for them to not give out peanuts so I won't get sick because I'm allergic.
Everybody should drink Sprite and eat Pringles and Pretzels."""""

Doctor-Mom: ""I would support a full ban of peanut products on any airline.
Peanut reactions can be life threatening.
An individual doesn't have to consume the product to have a life threatening reaction.
They can have contact or inhalation reactions.
Restricting to certain flights is not enough,
as residue can be rampant.
Providing buffer zones is a thoughtful gesture,
but from a practical point of view does not work.
With so many food choices available, why are peanuts a necessary choice?

If there are packaged peanuts served on board a flight, it's 100% guaranteed that I will have a reaction from the peanut dust.
I do not agree with a buffer zone for a couple of reasons.
For me, it's the dust in the air.
Someone posted that the air circulates peanut dust right out of the air
but apparently not quick enough to prevent a life threatening reaction.
You know, airlines tried to create nonsmoking zones on airplanes but that didn't work either.
I have been on flights where nasty (and do I mean NASTY) flight attendants have made sarcastic remarks about me and my allergies especially on one Delta flight.
Northwest was great
because they respected their passengers enough to address their concerns
and prohibited peanuts altogether.
It was as much a relief to walk onto one of their flights as it was to walk onto one of the first smoke free flights!
Smokers use to use the same logic and reasoning to justify smoking on flights as these peanut proponents are using now.
I flew on many smoking flights and never needed to inject myself so that I could breathe

lauraclare_136,"lauraclare: ""I have two children with potentially life threatening allergies to peanuts.
Unlike what one person commented, this is not a latest illness fad.
The latest research indicates that peanut allergy doubled in children from 1997 to 2002 and that number continues to increase.
It is one of the most deadly food allergies.
The presence of nuts on planes is a real fear.
While my kids have other potentially deadly food allergies,
peanuts pose a unique risk.
Nuts break into fine pieces with dust that can become airborne.
Peanut butter is sticky and gets wiped on seats and tray tables.
Even the slightest microscopic amount of nuts can create an anaphylactic reaction.
Although EpiPens can help,
they are not 100% effective
and should not be considered a solution to the risk peanuts pose to allergic individuals on planes.
Additional steroids, Benadryl shots, oxygen and other medical intervention may be necessary to stop an anaphylactic reaction.
EpiPens may need to be administered every 15 to 30 minutes as well.
People still die even with intervention.

The cost and stress of handing him over to cargo is wearing me down and I will most likely not take him on some future trips so they will loose my business.

On one side is the fact that sitting for an excessive amount of time is uncomfortable at best and unhealthy at worst.
However, on the other side there will be considerable time lost with the deplaning and reboarding.
One item which should be addressed is food and drink.
If the airline would normally have food for the passengers on that flight it seems silly to deny access to anything more than a bag of peanuts and a glass of water.
This happened to my husband last week on a Delta flight from Newark to Amsterdam.
The passengers were sitting on the plane for over six hours, at the gate,

One does not purchase a ticket hoping to reach a certain destination.
Same as if one pays $4 for a cup of coffee or $1, the cup is supposed to have coffee in it.
The price does not dictate that ""maybe"" you will get the product or service.
Also, the airline decides what prices or miles are used to purchase a promise to get you from point A to point B.
If they can not afford to give  a ticket for that price, they should not sell it.
When you reserve a ticket, the assumption is that you will be taken from point A to point B by the times given by the airline.
A passenger does not purchase a ticket just to see if maybe they can get somewhere because they have nothing better to do."""
travellots_133_2,"travellots: ""If compensation is not high enough, the airlines will not have an incentive to schedule properly.
It is not fair to allow airlines to discriminate against lower fared passengers or ""free"" passengers

Otherwise, airlines can advertise low fares or con you into using them to build up your ""miles"" and then always bump you for someone who paid more.
In away,it is the same as being able to increase your ticket price anytime after purchase.
When you are bumped, there are a lot of hidden extra costs
It irks me that airlines seem to be treating passengers more and more as if they have nothing better to do but wait around in airports and not get to where the airline promised to bring them.
Again, the airline sets the agreed price or miles for a seat, no one else.
The incentives to the airline should be to get all confirmed passengers (regardless of price paid) to the destination promised."""

They 've never endorsed anybody before on immigration
I was just recently endorsed—16,500 Border Patrol agents
when Secretary Clinton talks about this , I mean , I 'll take the admirals and I 'll take the generals any day over the political hacks that I see that have led our country so brilliantly over the last 10 years with their knowledge
look at the mess that we 're in
As far as the cyber , I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said
We should be better than anybody else
perhaps we 're not
I do n't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC"""
TRUMP_192,"TRUMP: ""President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq
they got out—what , they should n't have been in
once they got in , the way they got out was a disaster
ISIS was formed
she talks about taking them out
She 's been doing it a long time
She 's been trying to take them out for a long time
they would n't have even been formed if they left some troops behind , like 10,000 or maybe something more than that
then you would n't have had them
as I 've been saying for a long time
I think you 'll agree
I said it to you once
had we taken the oil—and we should have taken the oil—ISIS would not have been able to form either
we should have taken the oil
the oil was their primary source of income
now they have the oil all over the place
including the oil—a lot of the oil in Libya
was another one of her disasters"""
TRUMP_202_1,"TRUMP: ""The secretary said very strongly about working with—we've been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen
You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess
Under your direction, to a large extent
you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that's another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly
They were choking on the sanctions
now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going
when you look at NATO
I was asked on a major show, what do you think of NATO
you have to understand, I'm a businessperson
I did really well
I have common sense. And I said, well, I'll tell you. I haven't given lots of thought to NATO. But two things
the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren't paying their fair share"""
TRUMP_202_2,"TRUMP: ""that bothers me
we should be asking—we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract
NATO could be obsolete
I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest—but I said, they do not focus on terror
 I was very strong. And I said it numerous times
about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division
that's great. And I think we should get
we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO
It's a lot of money to protect other people. But I'm all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also
they're going to do that
 I'm not going to get credit for it—but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO
we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast
when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton. And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. Not only that, you named the day. They couldn't believe it. They sat back probably and said, I can't believe it"""
TRUMP_222,"TRUMP: ""I have much better judgment than she does

TRUMP_236,"TRUMP: ""It 's not an accurate one at all
It 's not an accurate one
I just want to give a lot of things
just to respond
I agree with her on one thing
The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament , nuclear weapons
not global warming
like you think
your—your president thinks
Nuclear is the single greatest threat
Just to go down the list , we defend Japan , we defend Germany , we defend South Korea , we defend Saudi Arabia , we defend countries
They do not pay us
they should be paying us
we are providing tremendous service
we 're losing a fortune
we 're losing
we lose on everything
All I said , that it 's very possible that if they do n't pay a fair share
this is n't 40 years ago where we could do what we 're doing
if they do n't pay a fair share
We ca n't defend Japan , a behemoth , selling us cars by the million"""
TRUMP_240_1,"TRUMP: ""for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia , she 's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries
Russia has been expanding their
they have a much newer capability than we do
We have not been updating from the new standpoint
I looked the other night
I was seeing B-52s
they 're old enough that your father , your grandfather could be flying them
we are not keeping up with other countries
 I would like everybody to end it
just get rid of it
I would certainly not do first strike
once the nuclear alternative happens , it 's over
At the same time , we have to be prepared
I ca n't take anything off the table
you look at some of these countries , you look at North Korea , we 're doing nothing there
China should solve that problem for us
China should go into North Korea
China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea"""

I've got in front of me a letter from a credit card company
There are two figures on this letter which really stand out: 0% per annum new balance transfers, 0% per annum new money transfers
Now, underneath that, in small print, it becomes absolutely clear that you’ll be paying all sorts of charges
And then very, very quickly you’ll be lured into paying a very large charge
Do you think it’s responsible to encourage people to mis-read something like that?
I’ve got all the information there in front of me
Why is that irresponsible?"""
MT_45,"MT: ""Claire’s absolutely right about that
But then the problem is that that form of capitalism wasn’t generating sufficient surpluses
And so therefore where did the money flow
It didn’t flow into those industrial activities
 because in the developed world that wasn’t making enough money"""
ND_23,"ND: "" I think in the current situation that both savers and borrowers, if you're talking about individual people, are doing extremely badly
many people are unable to make ends meet and are having to take debt out at huge levels of interest
On the other hand, savers are earning nothing in interest
And what this needs is not simply us putting moral blame on one side or the other
but actually putting moral blame on a set of economic policies and political decisions that have led to credit liberalisation."""
CF_62,"CF: ""RS: Provide that for our young people
 These are young adults; you’re kind of treating them as though they’re passive recipients of something.
 And I suppose that’s my concern; how do we encourage the young?
It’s not beyond the imagination to imagine the young might get up and go and do something about this, other than kind of sit and wait to be handed something.
Now you’re saying “Provide that for our young people”, and in a way that’s where I’m going."""
JW_35,"JW: ""JW has got a rather nuanced view, that the way they're mis-used can have morally damaging consequences
Well, debt is morally neutral in the sense that it can be good to be in debt
 Sometimes it’s a good idea, and sometimes it’s a bad idea
And so I think there’s been broad agreement about that in the discussion so far
The question is why is there too much debt?
 Why are people taking on too much debt?
 this one is the elaboration of the previous question Now,
a lot of people come up with rather glib moral answers: somehow bankers want them to get into excessive debt
 which is a very peculiar idea, when you think that it’s the bankers who aren’t going to get repaid. So it’s a very odd idea
there’s too much debt for the same reason that there are too many unmarried mothers, and for the same reason that you get an overproduction of sheep."""
CLINTON_1_1,"CLINTON: ""The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we 'll build together
Today is my granddaughter 's second birthday
I think about this a lot
we have to build an economy that works for everyone , not just those at the top
we need new jobs , good jobs , with rising incomes
I want us to invest in you
I want us to invest in your future
jobs in infrastructure , in advanced manufacturing , innovation and technology , clean , renewable energy , and small business
most of the new jobs will come from small business
We also have to make the economy fairer
That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee , finally , equal pay for women 's work

you were trying to—you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb , very famous pictures
I do n't think you can deny that
just last week , your campaign manager said it was true
