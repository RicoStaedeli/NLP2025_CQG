Many school are combating this by offering a wide variety of college level (AP and IB) and duel credit classes to allow ambitious students to get ahead. AP classes are great, but they teach to a test and are very formulaic. If a student has a real passion for a subject, they might miss it in the droll high school environment. For students who aren't up for the challenge of an AP or duel credit class (or for students who attend schools that don't offer these options), they often hear the same material twice: once in their high school level class and once in their college level class. There is no reason why a student would need to take two virtually identical government classes or two statistic classes in a two year window.

But I am having trouble disagreeing with the view of \"Neither I nor my ancestors did anything, why should I pay?\". This would be in line with the views of white people with immigrant ancestors (who also went through hardships and discrimination) who did not partake in slavery or discrimination in any form. I often see the comparison of paying reparations to the Jews by Germany and I find that different since those reparations were made shortly after AND everyone or their ancestors in Germany either was a Nazi-supporter or silently compliant during the genocides. I know reparations in the U.S. are as much about slavery as they are about recent discrimination from the 1900s. But, it's been long enough that not everyone was around or had ancestors around in the U.S. during that time, and even for those who did, their ancestors weren't necessarily silently compliant -- they may have even marched with African Americans to get them their rights.

    "context":"alternate_viewpoints_perspectives: Veronza Bowers Jr. is a former Black Panther Party member from California who has been in jail in the USA for over 46 years for allegedly murdering a park ranger. I'll quote directly from the website run by his family and friends to explain why that's a bunch of bullshit. In 1973, Veronza was convicted in the murder of a U.S. Park Ranger on the word of two government informers, both o whom received reduced sentences for other crimes by the Federal prosecutor's office. There were no eye-witnesses and no evidence independent of these informants to link him to the crime. At his trial, Veronza offered alibi testimony which was not credited by the jury. Nor was testimony of two relatives of the informants who insisted that they were lying.",
