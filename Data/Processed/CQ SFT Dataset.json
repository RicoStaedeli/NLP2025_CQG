But if you can't turn a profit in the first 2 decades then tough, your content wasn't very good. But the larger purpose of having a lengthy copyright is not to incentivize content, but amass a huge library that in aggregate can still be profited from long after the original artists have likely moved on to other projects. The obvious downside is that there would be that financing of content would be disrupted there wouldn't be the willingness to sink costs upfront if there wasn't a chance for a lifetime of income from the copyright. But I believe that this discourages content since content creating companies become overly dependent on their catalog of content rather than create new material. I understand that making Friends and Seinfeld, along with the Beatles and Notorious B.I.G. 's entire discography public domain would be the upside, but what major downside would there be if the copyright would be limited to 20 years.",

Fault - we might reasonably say that it's the parents fault that the fetus is dependent on the mother for survival, but since a rare disease can't reasonably be forseen, the parents are not at fault. On the other hand, everyone knows a fetus requires its mother to survive, and so the dependency is easily forseen. We generally ascribe higher obligations for people who are at fault in a situation than not at fault. someone's body is being used against their will to keep another person alive, surely if abortion is just about the rights of the fetus to life being more important than ones right to bodily autonomy, then the same conclusions about what the law should be will apply here.",

The lower demographic will always exist, whether by choice or circumstance. The main thing is that people won't be afraid to be without a job, and so you'll get more people willing to move to rural areas and live exclusively on UBI while finding a job. Since there will be more telecommute jobs (including relatively low-end jobs like data entry, online customer service, etc., not to mention selling things), they'll be able to settle, leaving vacancies in the city. The main thing that holds people back from that now is just the fear that they won't be able to survive, so they stick to the city where their chances are best. A lot of poorer people in the city would like to move to a more rural area, and a number of them would even be willing to maintain their same lifestyle to do it.

There is nothing wrong with \"speciesism\", our very existence is speciesist, if you clear an animal habitat for crops, that's speciesism because you are destroying animal's home for the sake of your own species.

Now, the senile, depend on the mental state, if such person is metally retarded to the point of amorality then they do get diminished rights, normally they're put in an institution are they are a harm to others and themselves, such person would be better off through euthanasia with consent of the family, but that is my opinion, moving about this concepts inevitably can lead in a debate of abortion and euthaniasia, which I don't want.

Topics including climate change, transgender rights, abortion, etc. come from a place of motivated skepticism, confirmation bias, and the dunning Kruger effect where they believe their own judgement is correct even in the absence of the ability to understand the scientific literature or statistical data. For example, the recent Arkansas ban on gender affirming surgery for trans youth flies in the face of decades of evidence showing the extremely high benefits of providing such services. The abortion debate, including the rule in Texas to require abortion clinics to maintain surgerical level cleanliness, which was presented as a safety measure, discounts the fact that abortion is overall safer than giving birth.

My opinion is that even though you would indeed change what card you would draw, you're just losing the ability to draw a card you don't even know. Normally, shuffling a deck is done so players have no control or knowledge about what cards they will draw, and this is still the case whether you shuffle it randomly or not during the game, so I don't understand why turning 1 shuffled deck into another shuffled deck when both are already 100% random.

Therefore, if I was born without the two health conditions I currently have, the end result of God's plan would not be changed at all.

Before a patient is placed under a cocktail of drugs that effect their memory, there should be a direct proactive option for them to record it.

It upsets some of them to a point they will not provide any additional services for comfort and recovery beyond what they are allowed to withhold.

They even proactively ask if sentimental jewelery is requested in the OR. And I also realize major operations are heavily monitored. But even the minor operations should be recorded for the patient, for a fee. You are taking away someone's memories.

Fault - we might reasonably say that it's the parents fault that the fetus is dependent on the mother for survival, but since a rare disease can't reasonably be forseen, the parents are not at fault. On the other hand, everyone knows a fetus requires its mother to survive, and so the dependency is easily forseen. We generally ascribe higher obligations for people who are at fault in a situation than not at fault. someone's body is being used against their will to keep another person alive, surely if abortion is just about the rights of the fetus to life being more important than ones right to bodily autonomy, then the same conclusions about what the law should be will apply here.",

I'm not saying that their deaths are justified, but you also can't say they are being discriminated against because of just racism (I won't say racism isn't a factor). Actually, if the death rate from violent crimes correlated with the crime rate from that demographic, then the death rate would be much higher if you compared it to any other crime rate vs death rate of any other demographic. Which means that police are actively trying not to cause those deaths in that specific demographic (likely because of the backlash that is born from it).

Movie theaters right now can cut down on theater hopping because they usher patrons in and out of the theater in herds. Once all the patrons are let out of a screen\/stage, they're done with that screen\/stage for good. Theaters could get around this by re-checking ticket stubs upon re-entry to the screen\/stage after intermission, but this would require 1) time - another long line for each patron to stand in before re-entering could add 5-10 full minutes to the already 5-10 minute long intermission, and 2) manpower.",
