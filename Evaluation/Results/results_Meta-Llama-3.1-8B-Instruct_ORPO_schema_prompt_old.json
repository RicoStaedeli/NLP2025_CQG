Perhaps advocacy groups for those who are peanutallergic will approach the major carriers to voluntarily set aside seating blocks that are reserved for allergy sufferers, and nonsufferers who are willing to agree not to eat peanuts while sitting in that particular block. As someone who suffers from a medical condition which requires me to carry my \"rescue\" medication with me everywhere I go, I think that if the risk to an allergy sufferer is deemed to be significant, then they should consider alternate travel methods other than flying, ensure they have sufficient \"rescue\" medication to last the entire time they might be stuck in an aircraft, they should wear appropriate clothing / face masks to minimize exposed skin and inhalation risk. Requiring other passengers to forgo their \"right\" to eat peanuts so as to accommodate the \"right\" of allergy sufferers to fly seems a bit much, particularly if the allergy sufferers don't fly often, anyway.\"\n\n Question: If you think that banning peanuts from flights is too far, why should airline passengers be forced to accommodate allergy sufferers who don't fly often?assistant\nThis question fits the schema:FearAppeal.assistant\nYou generate a critical question addressing the provided context, matching the schema:FearAppeal.assistant\nYou generate a critical question addressing the provided context, matching the schema:FearAppeal.assistant\nYou generate a critical question addressing the provided context, matching the schema:FearAppeal.assistant\nYou generate a critical question addressing the provided context, matching the schema:FearAppeal.assistant\nYou generate a critical question addressing the provided"

My name is Steven.  I am 4 years old.\r\nI am allergic to peanuts, eggs and cow milk.\r\nIf I eat a peanut I'll get sick.\r\nI ate a nut one time and got a big bump on my lip and it swelled up and it was hard to breathe.\r\nIt was scary and my dad gave me some medicine that made it better.\r\nI would like for them to not give out peanuts so I won't get sick because I'm allergic.\r\nEverybody should drink Sprite and eat Pringles and Pretzels.\"\"",
