My name is Steven.  I am 4 years old.\r\nI am allergic to peanuts, eggs and cow milk.\r\nIf I eat a peanut I'll get sick.\r\nI ate a nut one time and got a big bump on my lip and it swelled up and it was hard to breathe.\r\nIt was scary and my dad gave me some medicine that made it better.\r\nI would like for them to not give out peanuts so I won't get sick because I'm allergic.\r\nEverybody should drink Sprite and eat Pringles and Pretzels.\"\" Respond only with the question and nothing else.assistant\n\nQuestion:assistant\n\nDoes the severity of the reactions experienced by the physician's son, including multiple life-threatening anaphylactic reactions, justify the implementation of peanut-free buffer zones on flights to ensure his safety and the safety of others with similar allergies?"
