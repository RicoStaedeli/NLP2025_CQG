My name is Steven.  I am 4 years old.\r\nI am allergic to peanuts, eggs and cow milk.\r\nIf I eat a peanut I'll get sick.\r\nI ate a nut one time and got a big bump on my lip and it swelled up and it was hard to breathe.\r\nIt was scary and my dad gave me some medicine that made it better.\r\nI would like for them to not give out peanuts so I won't get sick because I'm allergic.\r\nEverybody should drink Sprite and eat Pringles and Pretzels.\"\"",
