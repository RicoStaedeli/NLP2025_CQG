      "Li Na Li Na (; ; born 26 February 1982) is a retired Chinese professional tennis player, who achieved a career-high WTA-ranking of world No. 2 on 17 February 2014.  Over the course of her career, Li won seven WTA singles titles and two Grand Slam singles titles at the 2011 French Open and 2014 Australian Open.  Li's rise to prominence came after those victories, which made her the first and only Grand Slam singles champion from East Asia and Asia as a whole.  Prior to this, she had already become the first player representing an East Asian and Asian country to appear in a Grand Slam singles final, a milestone she achieved at the 2011 Australian Open.  Li was also the runner-up at the 2013 Australian Open and 2013 WTA Tour Championships, a three-time quarterfinalist at Wimbledon and a semifinalist at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games and 2013 US Open.  Among her other most notable accolades, she was the first Chinese player to win a WTA tour title at the Guangzhou International Women's Open in 2004, the first to reach a Grand Slam singles quarterfinal at the 2006 Wimbledon Championships, and the first to break into the world's top 10.  Her feats have sparked a major population growth of tennis players in East Asia, earning her the reputation as the region's tennis pioneer and trailblazer. Williams sisters The Williams sisters are two professional American tennis players: Venus Williams (b. 1980), a seven-time Grand Slam title winner (singles), and Serena Williams (b. 1981), twenty-three-time Grand Slam title winner (singles), both of whom were coached from an early age by their parents Richard Williams and Oracene Price.  There is a noted professional rivalry between them â€“ between the 2001 US Open and the 2017 Australian Open tournaments, they met in nine Grand Slam singles finals.  They became the first two players, female or male, to play in 4 consecutive grand slam singles finals from the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian Open; Serena famously won all 4 to complete the first of two \"Serena Slams\".  Between 2000 and 2016, a 17-year span, they collectively won 12 Wimbledon singles titles (Venus won 5 and Serena won 7).  By winning the 2001 Australian Open women's doubles title, they became the 5th pair to complete the Career Doubles Grand Slam and the only pair to complete the Career Doubles Golden Slam.  At the time, Venus and Serena were only 20 and 19 years old, respectively.  Since then they have gone on to add another two Olympic gold medals in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2012 London Olympics.  Nearly a decade later, the duo would go on to win 4 consecutive grand slam doubles titles from 2009 Wimbledon through 2010 Roland Garros, which would catapult them to co-No.  1 doubles players on 7 June 2010.  Two weeks later, on 21 June 2010, Serena would hold the No. 1 singles ranking and Venus would be right behind her at No. 2 in singles.  Their most recent grand slam doubles titles came at the 2012 Wimbledon & 2016 Wimbledon events.  They remain very close, often watching each other's matches in support, even after one of them has been knocked out of a tournament. Henri Leconte Henri Leconte (born 4 July 1963) is a former French professional tennis player.  He reached the men's singles final at the French Open in 1988, won the French Open men's doubles title in 1984, and helped France win the Davis Cup in 1991.  Leconte's career-high singles ranking was world No. 5. Steffi Graf Stefanie Maria \"Steffi\" Graf (] ; born 14 June 1969) is a German former tennis player, who was ranked world No. 1 during her career.  Graf won 22 Grand Slam singles titles.  Her 22 singles titles put her second on the list of Major wins in the female competition since the introduction of the Open Era in 1968 and is third all-time behind Margaret Court (24) and Serena Williams (23).  In 1988, she became the first and only tennis player (male or female) to achieve the Golden Slam by winning all four Grand Slam singles titles and the Olympic gold medal in the same calendar year.  Furthermore, she is the only tennis player to have won each Grand Slam event at least four times. 1986 Grand Prix German Open The 1986 German Open (also known as the 1986 Ebel German Open) was a men's tennis tournament of the 1986 Nabisco Grand Prix and played on outdoor red clay courts.  It was the 77th edition of the event.  It took place at the Am Rothenbaum in Hamburg, West Germany, from 15 September through 21 September 1986.  Henri Leconte won the singles title.  Fourth-seeded Henri Leconte won the singles title. Jonathan Stark (tennis) Jonathan Stark (born April 3, 1971) is a former professional tennis player from the United States.  During his career he won two Grand Slam doubles titles (the 1994 French Open Men's Doubles and the 1995 Wimbledon Championships Mixed Doubles).  Stark reached the World No. 1 doubles ranking in 1994. Pam Teeguarden Pam Teeguarden (born April 17, 1951) is a former American professional tennis player in the 1970s and 1980s, ranked in the top 20 from 1970â€“1975, according to \"John Dolan's Women's Tennis Ultimate Guide\", prior to computer rankings.  She won two Grand Slam Doubles Titles and was a quarter finalist in singles at the U.S. Open and The French Open.  Her father Jerry, a well known coach, helped Margaret Court win the coveted Grand Slam (all four Grand Slam titles in one year) in 1970 and Virginia Wade to her 1977 Wimbledon triumph.  Teeguarden was voted the \"Most Watchable Player\" based on play and appearance by a group of Madison Avenue advertising executives or \"Mad Men\" while playing at the US Open.  Teeguarden played in 19 consecutive US Opens, holding the record until Chris Evert played in 20.  She wore the first all black outfit in the history of tennis in 1975 at The Bridgestone Doubles Championships in Tokyo, starting a trend that is still popular today.  Teeguarden was the first woman tennis player signed by Nike.  She played on the victorious Los Angeles Strings Team Tennis team in 1981 and won the Team Tennis Mixed Doubles Division with Tom Gullikson in 1977; they were also runners-up in the league that year. Ken Rosewall Kenneth Robert Rosewall {'1': \", '2': \", '3': 'AM, MBE', '4': \"} (born 2 November 1934) is a former world top-ranking amateur and professional tennis player from Australia.  He won a record 23 tennis Majors including 8 Grand Slam singles titles and before the Open Era a record 15 Pro Slam titles and a record 35 Major finals overall.  He won the Pro Grand Slam in 1963.  Rosewall won 9 slams in doubles with a career double grand slam.  He is considered to be one of the greatest tennis players of all time.  He had a renowned backhand and enjoyed a long career at the highest levels from the early 1950s to the early 1970s.  Rosewall was one of the two best male players for about nine years and was the World No. 1 player for a number of years in the early 1960s.  He was ranked among the top 20 players, amateur or professional, every year from 1952 through 1977.  Rosewall is the only player to have simultaneously held Pro Grand Slam titles on three different surfaces (1962â€“1963).  At the 1971 Australian Open he became the first male player during the open era to win a Grand Slam tournament without dropping a set. 2009 Serena Williams tennis season Serena Williams's 2009 tennis season officially began at the 2009 Medibank International Sydney.  Williams finished the year ranked world no. 1 for the second time in her career, having played in 16 tournaments, more than any other year.  She also broke the record previously set by Justine Henin for the most prize money earned by a female tennis player in one year, with Williams earning $6,545,586.  In doubles, she finished the year ranked world no. 3, despite playing only six tournaments as a pair.  She won five Grand Slam titles, putting her total Grand Slam titles at 23.
